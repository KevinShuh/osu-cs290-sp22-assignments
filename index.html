      <li>First</li>
        <p>what is the most complex or interesting thing you've done with your current web development skills? If you've never done anything related to web development, that's fine, but make sure to say that here.</p>
        <p>I had an experience of desining a website using dreamweaver many years ago, but I didn't do any coding when I was trying to use the very old version of dreamweaver because I thought that was too complex. However now I'm majoring in CS, so the most interesting thing for me is to desine with coding.

        <p>what do you hope to learn from this class?</p>
          I want to learn some basic skill of coding for website design.
